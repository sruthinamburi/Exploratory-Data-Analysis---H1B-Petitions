# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---H1B-Petitions

The H-1B is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1-B visa, an US employer must offer a job and petition for H-1B visa with the US immigration department. This is the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college/ higher education (Masters, PhD) and work in a full-time position.

Goals:
I would like to find the 
top 5 states with the least denial rate.
top 5 employers who have filed H1B for its employees 
top 5 job titles for which H1B was filed

In addition I would like to recommend the top 5 state - employer - title which has a higher scope for acceptance.
